# Note Taker
    
## Description
This application is a useful tool for keeping track of various tidbits of information in order to recall it. Note taker successfully solves this problem by storing your various notes, thoughts, musings, and ideas in one concise and traversable space.

This application is important because it allows the user to jot information down in the moment and recall that same information when they acutally need it rather than focus on that particular idea until they need it. Essentially, the user can now "set it and forget it!"
